 * The fabricated field the boards rank.

 * Every rival is a display name and a canonical XP; their face, level, career
 * and dossier are all expanded from those two seeds, so the same rival reads
 * identically on a row, on the podium and in their dossier.
 *
 * The app's roster carries a twenty-fourth seed — `pai`, 3,870 XP — standing in
 * for the player at a permanent rank #12. The web has a real profile to rank
 * instead, so that seed is gone and the board splices the live player in at
 * their actual XP. Every other seed is verbatim, movements and badges included.
