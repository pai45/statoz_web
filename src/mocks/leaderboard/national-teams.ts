/**
 * The tournament board's TEAMS field: sixteen national sides with the points
 * and movements the app ships. Their colours are the real national identity
 * colours, which is why they are hex literals rather than palette tokens — a
 * crest is the team's colour, not the product's.
 *
 * Argentina is flagged as the side the player backs, exactly as the app ships
 * it. A team board ranks teams rather than players, so unlike the players
 * board there is no live standing to put in its place.
