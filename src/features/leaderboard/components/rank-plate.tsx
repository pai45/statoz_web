/**
 * The board's shared surface: a flat fill inside a chamfered edge.
 *
 * The app draws every podium tile, row, chip and pill with one
 * `cutCornerDecoration`, which cuts the top-left and bottom-right corners and
 * leaves the other two square — the HUD chamfer with no answering cut, which is
 * exactly what `hudChamferPath(cut, 0)` describes. Only the cut size and the
 * two colours change between them, so they are all this component.
 *
 * It is not `HudPanel`: that fixes the silhouette at 14/4 and always paints an
 * accent edge, where a board needs seven different cuts and an edgeless plate
 * for the rows that are not yours.
 *
 * Built as an edge layer with the fill inset a pixel inside it, because a clip
 * path crops a border away.
 */

/**
 * A translucent fill, resolved against the page ground as an opaque colour.
 *
 * The app strokes a one-pixel border and fills behind it, so its translucent
 * fills sit on the scaffold. A clip path crops a border away, so the web has to
 * draw the edge as a plate *behind* the fill — which means a translucent fill
 * would blend into the edge instead of the page, and a strongly tinted edge
 * would swallow the fill whole. Mixing against the ground here keeps every
 * plate the colour the app painted rather than the colour of its own border.
