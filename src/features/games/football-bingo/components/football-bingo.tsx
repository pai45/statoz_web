/**
 * Football Bingo — the web port of `FootballBingoTabContent`.
 *
 * Three screens over one season: the landing page, the archive, and the grid
 * itself. The orchestrator owns which of them is showing and which day is open,
 * and nothing else — the season lives in storage, and every screen reads it.
 *
 * The season is opened in an effect rather than on read: it needs the browser's
 * clock and it writes, neither of which a render may do. It reopens when the
 * local date rolls over, so a tab left up overnight finds tomorrow's grid
 * waiting rather than yesterday's.
